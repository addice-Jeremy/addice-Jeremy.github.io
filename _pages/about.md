I’m currently a junior at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in [Statistics & Machine Learning](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/dietrichcollegeofhumanitiesandsocialsciences/departmentofstatistics/#statsmltext) with additional minors in [Artifical Intelligence](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/bs-in-artificial-intelligence/minor) and [Business Analytics](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/undergraduate-business/curriculum/majors-and-minors.html). I like to use data science to add value - I am passionate about leveraging my skills in data science, machine learning, and artifical intelligence to meaningful projects. 

Let's connect with any potential opportunities. You can reach me by [jiabinl@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:“jiabinl@andrew.cmu.edu") or [lij061703@gmail.com](mailto:“lij061703@gmail.com").

Outside of academics, I play sports including badminton, biking, and volleyball. I also like to play strategic games with no one definite correct way such as poker and chess. In addition, I love to be spontaneous, cook, play FPS games, explore new cities, and watch movies!
