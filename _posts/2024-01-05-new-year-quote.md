<blockquote>
    ”你会焦虑是因为你有完成这件事的能力。“ <br><br>

    You're anxious about something because you have the ability to accomplish it.
</blockquote>

I recently came across this on Xiaohongshu, and I thought it made a lot of sense. If you're nervous or anxious about completing a task, it's likely that you want to get it done or you can get it done. However, you're nervous about getting it done well or to your expectations. In 2024, I'm excited to be nervous; I know I can do them well, that's precisely why I will be anxious.
